       "      <td>This historic house stands on a tract of land in Pelham Bay Park that was purchased from the Siwanoy Indians in 1654 by Thomas Pell, an English doctor of medicine who had settled in Connecticut. The original acquisition, encompassing much of what is now Pelham Bay Park and part of the County of Westchester, became the Manor of Pelham in 1666 when a land grant was issued to Pell by Richard Nichols, the first English Governor of New York. The original house, completed in 1670 by Pell&amp;rsquo;s nephew, Sir John Pell, was destroyed during the American Revolution.Robert Bartow, a publisher and Pell descendant, purchased the estate in 1836. He undertook to build the elegant gray stone mansion whose Greek Revival interior featured a free-standing spiral staircase, a high-ceilinged double parlor and floor-to-ceiling windows on the second floor. The property remained in the family&amp;rsquo;s possession until 1888, when it was sold to the City.The house served briefly as a Home for Crippled Children, but by 1911 had been abandoned. In 1914 the house was restored and the sunken garden was added by the noted architectural firm of Delano and Aldrich. The mansion served Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia as a summer office in 1936. It was opened as a public museum in 1947. The building, with its sweeping view of Long Island Sound, is the only surviving estate out of more than two dozen that once overlooked Pelham Bay. The carriage house was restored and opened to the public in 1993. The house and grounds have been designated New York City and National Historical Landmarks. They have been operated by the International Garden Club since 1914. The property is one of the 19 historic houses located in city parks which the Historical House Trust of New York City helps to support.The Bartow-Pell Mansion stands within the bounds of Pelham Bay Park, the largest property in the City park system. Its 2,764 acres are bounded on the north by Westchester County, on the east by City Island and Long Island Sound, on the south by Watt Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, and on the west by the Hutchinson River Parkway. Acquired by the state legislature in 1888 at the prodding of the New York Park Association, the park now includes many active recreational amenities like Pelham Bay Golf Course (1914), Split Rock Golf Course (1936), Orchard Beach (1936) with its public bathing facility, ballfields, and tennis courts. The Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, established by local law in 1967, protect 489 acres of marshes and forests within the park.</td>\n",

       "0  This historic house stands on a tract of land in Pelham Bay Park that was purchased from the Siwanoy Indians in 1654 by Thomas Pell, an English doctor of medicine who had settled in Connecticut. The original acquisition, encompassing much of what is now Pelham Bay Park and part of the County of Westchester, became the Manor of Pelham in 1666 when a land grant was issued to Pell by Richard Nichols, the first English Governor of New York. The original house, completed in 1670 by Pell&rsquo;s nephew, Sir John Pell, was destroyed during the American Revolution.Robert Bartow, a publisher and Pell descendant, purchased the estate in 1836. He undertook to build the elegant gray stone mansion whose Greek Revival interior featured a free-standing spiral staircase, a high-ceilinged double parlor and floor-to-ceiling windows on the second floor. The property remained in the family&rsquo;s possession until 1888, when it was sold to the City.The house served briefly as a Home for Crippled Children, but by 1911 had been abandoned. In 1914 the house was restored and the sunken garden was added by the noted architectural firm of Delano and Aldrich. The mansion served Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia as a summer office in 1936. It was opened as a public museum in 1947. The building, with its sweeping view of Long Island Sound, is the only surviving estate out of more than two dozen that once overlooked Pelham Bay. The carriage house was restored and opened to the public in 1993. The house and grounds have been designated New York City and National Historical Landmarks. They have been operated by the International Garden Club since 1914. The property is one of the 19 historic houses located in city parks which the Historical House Trust of New York City helps to support.The Bartow-Pell Mansion stands within the bounds of Pelham Bay Park, the largest property in the City park system. Its 2,764 acres are bounded on the north by Westchester County, on the east by City Island and Long Island Sound, on the south by Watt Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, and on the west by the Hutchinson River Parkway. Acquired by the state legislature in 1888 at the prodding of the New York Park Association, the park now includes many active recreational amenities like Pelham Bay Golf Course (1914), Split Rock Golf Course (1936), Orchard Beach (1936) with its public bathing facility, ballfields, and tennis courts. The Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, established by local law in 1967, protect 489 acres of marshes and forests within the park.   \n",

      "content     This historic house stands on a tract of land in Pelham Bay Park that was purchased from the Siwanoy Indians in 1654 by Thomas Pell, an English doctor of medicine who had settled in Connecticut. The original acquisition, encompassing much of what is now Pelham Bay Park and part of the County of Westchester, became the Manor of Pelham in 1666 when a land grant was issued to Pell by Richard Nichols, the first English Governor of New York. The original house, completed in 1670 by Pell&rsquo;s nephew, Sir John Pell, was destroyed during the American Revolution.Robert Bartow, a publisher and Pell descendant, purchased the estate in 1836. He undertook to build the elegant gray stone mansion whose Greek Revival interior featured a free-standing spiral staircase, a high-ceilinged double parlor and floor-to-ceiling windows on the second floor. The property remained in the family&rsquo;s possession until 1888, when it was sold to the City.The house served briefly as a Home for Crippled Children, but by 1911 had been abandoned. In 1914 the house was restored and the sunken garden was added by the noted architectural firm of Delano and Aldrich. The mansion served Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia as a summer office in 1936. It was opened as a public museum in 1947. The building, with its sweeping view of Long Island Sound, is the only surviving estate out of more than two dozen that once overlooked Pelham Bay. The carriage house was restored and opened to the public in 1993. The house and grounds have been designated New York City and National Historical Landmarks. They have been operated by the International Garden Club since 1914. The property is one of the 19 historic houses located in city parks which the Historical House Trust of New York City helps to support.The Bartow-Pell Mansion stands within the bounds of Pelham Bay Park, the largest property in the City park system. Its 2,764 acres are bounded on the north by Westchester County, on the east by City Island and Long Island Sound, on the south by Watt Avenue and Bruckner Boulevard, and on the west by the Hutchinson River Parkway. Acquired by the state legislature in 1888 at the prodding of the New York Park Association, the park now includes many active recreational amenities like Pelham Bay Golf Course (1914), Split Rock Golf Course (1936), Orchard Beach (1936) with its public bathing facility, ballfields, and tennis courts. The Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, established by local law in 1967, protect 489 acres of marshes and forests within the park.\n",

      "content     What was here before?Staten Island&rsquo;s South Shore was formed by clay, sand, and gravel deposited by the Wisconsin glacier. Lush woodlands and rich marine and freshwater resources made this area a very desirable location for human settlement.&nbsp;About 6,000 years ago, the Algonquian Lenape&rsquo;s ancestors established camps on bluffs overlooking Raritan Bay.&nbsp;European colonists developed a thriving oyster-harvesting industry in the 17th century, and a series of farms were established in the area. In the early 20th century, there was a summer cottage community in nearby Wolfe&rsquo;s Pond Park, though it was ultimately razed for the building of that park.How did this site become a playground?The City acquired the land for this playground in 1960, and it opened in 1967. It is a Jointly Operated Playground (JOP) serving Elias Bernstein Intermediate School 7 and the local community. Beginning in 1938, the Board of Education (now the Department of Education) agreed to provide land next to schools where NYC Parks could build and maintain playgrounds that could be used by the school during the day and by the public when school is not in session. The site was formerly known as Huguenot Playground due to its location on Huguenot Avenue, which also gives its name to the nearby Public School 5.In 2021, the playground was reconstructed to include new play equipment and upgraded infrastructure.Who is this playground named for?This playground was renamed in 1997 in honor of Christopher J. Prescott (1972-1994), a native of Staten Island and the first New York City Emergency Medical Service worker to be killed in the line of duty.&nbsp;On the night of June 17, 1994, Prescott and his partner were assisting a person injured in an automobile accident when a vehicle driven by a drunk driver struck the EMS crew and their patient.&nbsp;Hours later, Prescott died from his injuries at Kings County Hospital.Prescott was educated at Public School 5 and Intermediate School 7, local Staten Island schools, St. Joseph-by-the-Sea High School, and the College of Staten Island.&nbsp;He joined the Emergency Medical Service in 1993 and was assigned to Station 34 in East New York, Brooklyn.&nbsp;His exceptional patient care and commitment to his coworkers during his first year earned him the title of &ldquo;Rookie of the Year&rdquo; from his colleagues, who foresaw in Prescott a promising career.\n",

      "content     Roald Engelbregt Gravning Amundsen (1872-1928), polar explorer, was born in Borge, Norway. When he was 20 years old, Amundsen abandoned the study of medicine and joined a seal-hunting expedition to the Arctic. In 1897, he was appointed first mate of the Belgian Antarctic Expedition. While their ship, Belgica, was trapped in ice for thirteen months, the captain developed scurvy and Amundsen was put in command. He managed to save the crew by providing fresh meat from frozen seal carcasses and to free the vessel by blasting a channel out of the ice with dynamite.During the years 1903-1905, Amundsen, now a licensed sea captain, led an expedition on which he determined the exact location of the Magnetic North Pole and successfully navigated the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, a route that had eluded European mariners.Amundsen is best known for being the first explorer to reach the South Pole, as well as to discover that it was located on a continental landmass. He reached the Pole by dogsled on December 14, 1911, just one month ahead of the Englishman Robert Falcon Scott, who died with his entire party on the return journey.In 1926, Amundsen flew from Norway to Alaska over the North Pole in the dirigible Norge and became the first man to cross from Europe to North America by way of the pole. Two years later, his plane disappeared in the Arctic during a mission to rescue Italian explorer Umberto Nobile. Nobile&rsquo;s dirigible Italia, a replica of the Norge, had crashed while en route to the North Pole.Roald Amundsen Plaza, located at Amboy Road and Clarke Avenue, was acquired by the city in 1928 and named for Amundsen on July 9, 1929. In 1933, the Norsemen Glee Club of Staten Island and the Norwegian Singing Society of Brooklyn placed a tablet on this site in honor of the pioneering Norwegian explorer.&nbsp;\n",

      "content     What was here before?This was once the property of Sir Roderick Cameron (1825-1900), a businessman who co-founded the R.W. Cameron and Company shipping line. The nearby Cameron Lake is named after his family.How did this site become a triangle?Corporal Michael J. Leonard Triangle is part of the Greenstreets program, which is a joint project of NYC Parks and the NYC Department of Transportation. Beginning in 1986, this initiative converted paved street properties, such as triangles and malls, into green spaces.Who is this triangle named for?Corporal Michael J. Leonard (1877-1918) was a native Staten Islander who sacrificed his life for his country in World War I. Leonard served with Company K of the 42nd Regiment during the Spanish-American War before working as a yard master for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. He re-enlisted after the United States declared war against Germany in 1917.Leaving behind a fifteen-year-old son, he sailed with Company F of the 165th Infantry to Europe in 1917 and fought in three battles with the &ldquo;Fighting 69th&rdquo; Regiment. He was killed in the Second Battle of the Marne, in France, on July 16, 1918, four months before the armistice on November 11 ended the war. Fifty years later, Grasmere Post #1191 of the American Legion erected a granite monument on this site in memory of Corporal Leonard.\n",

      "content     Graniteville Park, acquired by Parks in 1971, is located in    northwestern Staten Island, at Jules Drive, Elson Court, and Regis Drive. The    neighborhood of Graniteville was the site of quarries operated from the 1840s    to around 1896 to extract trap rock from the geological formation that includes    the Palisades. On August 4, 1997, this playground was dedicated to Jennifer    Schweiger (1974-1987), of Westerleigh, who was abducted and murdered on July    9, 1987 when she was twelve years old. The impetus to create a \"Playground for    All Children\" came from Community Board One and the \"Friends of Jennifer,\" a    community group which developed from the search party organized to find Jennifer    after she was kidnapped. A playground without barriers, it is a fitting tribute    to Jennifer, who had Down&rsquo;s Syndrome. Jennifer was a student at Public School    22 and loved to dance. She is greatly missed by her family, friends, and neighbors.  Construction of this state-of-the-art playground was funded    by Borough President Molinari at a cost of $2.3 million. The first of its kind    in Staten Island, it was designed to accommodate children with special needs.    Features include play equipment, game tables, sandboxes, spray showers, a picnic    area, sensory trails, gardens, lawns, landscaping, and a basketball court with    adjustable baskets. The entire facility is accessible by wheelchair. Also designed for children with special needs, the new Graniteville    Recreation Building opened to the public in 1998. It provides indoor space for    recreational activities and hosts a variety of specially designed programs.    The curving metal roof, bright orange brick walls, and aquamarine paint express    the spirit of fun and play. The dramatic, sail-like tensile structure atop the    roof extends off the side of the building to create a shaded space for outdoor    events. The building features cast-aluminum scuppers shaped like squids. \n",

      "content     What was here before?The land encompassing this park and the General Charles W. Berry Houses was once occupied by the Richmond County Fair Grounds. In 1905 the Richmond County Fair moved to the fairgrounds, after it was previously held in West New Brighton from 1895 to 1904. The new venue featured a grandstand, half-mile track, and 100-foot-long exhibition building specifically designed to host this annual event, which at the turn of the century was touted as the city&rsquo;s only county fair. It was replete with games, exhibitions, sporting events, and demonstrations. The fair ran until 1926 and was later revived in 1979 at Historic Richmond Town, where it is still held every year.How did this site become a park?General Douglas MacArthur Park was developed as part of the General Charles W. Berry Houses public housing project, named after a former Commander of the New York National Guard and City Comptroller. The park opened in April 1951, a year after the completion of the housing complex. In 2020, this project was fully reconstructed, which added a synthetic turf multiuse field, new basketball courts with bleacher seating, chess tables, adult fitness equipment, improved lighting, and more welcoming park edges and entrances.Who is this park named for?This park is named for General Douglas MacArthur (1880-1964), an important, if controversial, figure in American military history. MacArthur was born on January 26, 1880 in Little Rock Barracks, Arkansas. After graduating from West Point in 1903, he served as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army in France during World War I (1914-1918), and in the Philippine Islands and Mexico. In 1930, President Herbert Hoover (1874-1964) appointed MacArthur Chief of Staff of the Army.MacArthur retired in 1935 but was called back into service when America entered World War II (1939-1945) in 1941. In April 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945) named MacArthur the Supreme Allied Commander in the Pacific. On September 2, 1945, MacArthur accepted the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay and became the military governor of occupied Japan (1945-1950). He was later appointed Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations forces during the Korean War (1950-1953). Despite accolades for his bravery and ingenuity, his aggressive approach ultimately led to his dismissal in 1951 by President Harry S.

It opened to the public during the administration of Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. The construction and rehabilitation of hundreds of playgrounds throughout the five boroughs was facilitated by Commissioner Moses&rsquo; use of the financial and labor resources of the Federal Works Progress Administration. In 1974 the playground was renovated and named for Gerard P. Dugan under a local law introduced by City Councilmember (later Borough President) Anthony R. Gaeta and signed by Mayor Abraham D. Beame.

      "content     For outdoor pool details, including hours and rules, please visit our Free Outdoor Pools page.What was here before?The property was part of the Staten Island working waterfront and transferred from the Department of Docks to the Parks Department for recreational usage in 1934. &nbsp;How did this site become a pool?The summer of 1936, deep in the Great Depression, broke local heat records.&nbsp;Joseph H. Lyons Pool was one of eleven immense outdoor public pools the Parks Department opened that summer.&nbsp;The heroically-scaled pools project was financed by the Federal Works Progress Administration (WPA), as part of a massive effort to alleviate adverse health conditions and provide safe recreation in predominantly working-class communities.The pools were not just huge but also examples of state-of-the-art engineering and fine design.&nbsp; Each pool had separate swimming, diving and wading areas, perimeter bleachers, and bathhouses whose locker rooms served as gyms during non-summer months.&nbsp;Led by architect Aymar Embury II and landscape architect Gilmore D. Clarke, the planning team produced a series of distinct complexes, each one sensitive to its site and topography.&nbsp;Massive filtration systems, heating units, and even underwater lighting provided a more controlled bathing experience than the often treacherous and polluted waterways in which the City&rsquo;s masses had traditionally swum.&nbsp;The palette of pools building materials was mainly inexpensive brick, concrete and cast stone, but the styles ranged from Romanesque Revival to Art Deco.Located south of the St. George Ferry Terminal and adjacent to the Cromwell Recreation Pier, the pool measures 165 by 100 feet and had a capacity of 2,800 bathers.&nbsp;Designed by Joseph L. Hautman, in an Art Moderne style, the pool is distinguished by its sun deck and campanile. Its opening on July 7, 1936 was attended by 7,500 people.&nbsp;The only WPA pool in the borough, Mayor La Guardia commented at the dedication, &ldquo;The policy of this administration is to give Staten Island an even break with the other boroughs.&rdquo; He also described the opportunity to construct this elegant, modernist pool as &ldquo;a monument to the progressive government which would not and could not see unemployed men on the breadline.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is this pool named for?The pool was first known as Tompkinsville Pool, for the surrounding neighborhood named after former New York State governor Daniel D. Tompkins (1817-1825). In 1935, the year before the pool opened, the Board of Aldermen voted to name the pool in memory of World War I veteran Joseph H. Lyons (1874-1934). The pool was not officially renamed until Memorial Day 1938, when a dedication and renaming ceremony was held.Lyons joined the New York City Club Unit of the American Ambulance Field Service in 1917.&nbsp;He was awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French Government for his service driving on the French and Belgian fronts. Upon his return from Europe in 1920, he organized the Staten Island Post No. 563, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), of which he was the first commander.&nbsp;As a result of his activity in the VFW, he became county commander of the American Legion.&nbsp;Richmond Turnpike, Victory Boulevard, and the American Legion ferryboat were all named at the suggestion of Lyons.&nbsp;\n",

      "content     The unique topography of Mariner's Marsh Park has arisen partly from human handiwork, with nature completing the setting. Dotting the park's varied landscape are ten ponds, all of which were created in the early 20th century, when this was a bustling industrial workplace. Today, wildlife has reclaimed the area. The story of Mariner's Marsh represents a welcome twist to the typical scenario of environmental destruction at the hands of industrial development. Here animals and plants have benefitted from human alterations to the environment. People have lived, prospered, and altered the environment in Mariner's Marsh Park for centuries. Ancestors of the Lenape Indians camped here. Their burial and village sites were uncovered during an archaeological dig by the Museum of Natural History in the early 1900's. Native Americans survived on the rich beds of shellfish and other wildlife that flourished in the nearby salt marshes along the Island's shoreline (some of these marshes still exist today). The origin of the present-day landscape dates to about 1903, when the Milliken Brothers' Structural Iron Works and Rolling Mill built its plant here. Considered one of the world's largest manufacturers of steel products, Milliken Brothers survived until 1917, when the plant was converted to Downey's Shipyard. During World War I, the Mariner's Marsh area was bustling with activity. Downey's was fulfilling its large government shipbuilding contracts, and nearby, the Proctor and Gamble Company had established its tremendous factory for Ivory Soap and other products. As industrial activity on Staten Island waned in the latter half of the 20th century, these companies departed, leaving eerie ruins in their wake. Concrete supports and pylons, many of which have fallen into picturesque decay, silently tell of the site's industrial past. These structures supported a system of rails and runners which transported newly-built ships to water. Before this system was built, however, the area's water table had to be exposed. Extensive sand mining, which lowered the grade and brought the water table to the surface for the ships, created the basins which today hold ponds. The natural integrity of the Mariner's Marsh area has undergone many challenges due to industry, illegal dumping, and neglect. However, its value as a wildlife habitat has been recognized for many years. Area residents have historically appealed to the City concerning the lack of parkland on the Island's north shore. Mariner's Marsh was formally declared New York City parkland in 1997, due in part to the determined efforts of the Mariner's Marsh Conservancy. A non-profit volunteer group founded by local residents in 1995, the Conservancy conducts clean-ups, restoration work, educational programs, and research as well as serving as an advocate for Mariner's Marsh. A walk through Mariner's Marsh Red and White trails reveals the area's diversity of habitats and the wildlife they support. These include a Pin Oak swamp (with many trees from the 19th century), prairie grasslands near the Arlington Railyards, and the ten-pond system which is connected by small ditches and streams. The soils support several oak species, rare sedges, highbush blueberry, and many other plants. American Bittersweet, a vine with colorful red and yellow fruits, has been discovered in the park, making it the only known site for this species in New York City. Throughout the year, the ponds are active with waterfowl, and the grassy areas support uncommon birds such as the vesper sparrow. Short-eared owls use the park for their hunting grounds. Birds from the nearby Harbor Heron rookeries on Shooter's and Prall's Islands can be seen searching for food in the waterways. Muskrats plow through the waterways and build their lodges in the ponds. \n",

      "content     This park and the neighboring playground, east of the BMT Brighton Beach transit line, are named for postmaster William E. Kelly (1872-1929).  Born in Brooklyn, Kelly attended P.S. 9, P.S. 41, and evening high school.  After graduating with honors, he worked as an errand boy at Harper Brothers publishers.  He was also an amateur boxer.  In 1894 Kelly was hired by the Kings County post office, then the sixth largest in the nation.  He rose through the ranks.  He was president of the National Letter Carriers Association from 1907 to 1913.  He served as superintendent and assistant to the postmaster before President Woodrow Wilson appointed him as county postmaster.  Kelly served in this position from March 1914 to December 1915.  Kelly resigned as postmaster to serve as Clerk of Kings County, a public office, which he held from January 1916 until his death on September 20, 1929.\\tKelly&rsquo;s funeral at St. Gregory&rsquo;s Catholic Church in Brooklyn was attended by more than 10,000 mourners; the 250 honorary pallbearers included former Governor Alfred E. Smith and Mayor James J. Walker.  In 1930 a memorial to the outstanding postmaster was dedicated in William E. Kelly Park.  The monument consists of a small obelisk of Barre granite with a bronze relief portrait of Kelly sculpted by L. N. Anderson set within the stone.\\tKelly&rsquo;s daughter-in-law, Edna Flannery Kelly (1906&ndash;1997), was elected a member of the Executive Committee of the Democratic Party in Kings County from the 18th Assembly District, in 1944, 1946, and 1948.  In 1949, she won a special election to the second session of the 81st Congress, filling the vacancy in the 10th Congressional District following the death of Representative Andrew L. Somers.  She was reelected nine times and served in the U.S. House of Representatives until January 3, 1969.  The sole woman in the New York delegation, Representative Kelly was active both in foreign affairs and domestic social policy.  An expert on the Soviet Bloc, she rose to be the third-ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Edna Kelly was an active advocate for working families calling for tax deductions for child care, and in addition, is credited with passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which established the principle of equal pay for equal work for women.  Edna Kelly was married to Edward L. Kelly, who was a lawyer and justice of the City Court of New York prior to his death in 1942.\\tThe original tract of land for this park, to the west of the train tracks, was condemned in 1889 and 1906 for use as a pumping station.  In 1924 the site was conveyed to the Brooklyn Parks Department for use as a recreational area.  It was improved with tennis courts in the late 1920s, and named William E. Kelly Park by the Board of Aldermen in 1929.  In the spring of 1940, the park was expanded and improved, becoming the 324th playground to be newly built or renovated during the administration of Parks Commissioner Robert Moses.  An extensive recreation area, built by Works Projects Administration labor, included new baseball diamonds and tennis courts (adaptable for ice-skating after flooding and freezing), shuffleboard and volleyball courts, game tables, horseshoe pits, and children&rsquo;s play structures.\\tAdditional park parcels to the east of the train tracks were acquired in 1937 and 1944, but some of this land was transferred to the Board of Education in 1953 as recreational space for the new P.S. 255 (later renamed the Barbara Reing School).  A series of renovations to the park in 1977, 1983, 1988, and 1990 upgraded the play facilities, tennis courts and the comfort station.\\tIn 1998 Council Member (now U.S. Representative) Anthony Weiner funded an extensive capital renovation, at a cost of $630,000.  The park improvements, designed by Storch Associates, include play equipment, tot swings, a new planting grove, game tables, repaved paths, new fences, World&rsquo;s Fair benches, improved basketball and handball courts, a directional compass and a cast-concrete bear&mdash;in acknowledgment of the many Russian immigrants who have settled in the vicinity.  The project also included the cleaning and conservation of the Kelly monument and the installation of a Gametime Parcourse Fitcenter, an exercise circuit intended to promote cardiovascular health among park patrons.\n",
